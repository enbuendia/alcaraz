			     <h1>THE FALSE TRUFFLES</h1>
		      <p> People often ask us about &quot;truffles&quot; found around yards and gardens or in the countryside. They appear partially buried (hypogeous) or superficial. They are sometimes true truffles, but most of the time are false truffles, from a gastronomic point of view and and accepted as true truffles only those belonging to the genus Tuber. Even some of these false truffles can be toxic. <strong>Never eat any fungus unless you are absolutely sure of its identity!</strong></p>
		      <p>&nbsp;</p>
		      <p>The most frequently found species are:</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#scleroderma">&#8226; SCLERODERMA POLYRHIZUM</a></p>

				<h1><a name="scleroderma"></a>SCLERODERMA POLYRHIZUM</h1>
		      <p>It is a fungus that grows underground (like truffles), but eventually emerge though the soil surface to finish their development and <a href="trufas/Scleroderma polyrhizum3.jpg" rel="shadowbox" title="False truffles: Scleroderma polyrhizum">open in star-shaped</a>. It reaches a big size, 6-15 cm across before splitting, very tough and quite heavy. We can find them in open, sunny places,  along the edge of woods or along the edges of roads and highways, where they are capable of pushing the asphalt. <A HREF="trufas/Scleroderma polyrhizum2.jpg" rel="shadowbox" title="Scleroderma polyrhizum"><img title="Scleroderma polyrhizum" alt="Scleroderma polyrhizum" src="trufas/Scleroderma polyrhizum2.jpg" height="240" align="left" style="margin: 3px 10px" hspace="3"></A>It is a widespread species found in North America and Europe. We were recently asked about some <a href="trufas/Scleroderma Filipinas.jpg" rel="shadowbox" title="false truffles of Philippines">false truffles of Philippines </a> that we also found to be <em>Scleroderma polyrhizum</em>.</p>
		      <p>It is very easy to mistake a <em>Scleroderma polyrhizum</em> for a true truffle before splitting. In this case you need to cut the Scleroderma in half to see inside. <em>Scleroderma polyrhizum</em> has a very thick skin (peridium), hard and brown. The inside (gleba) is black to purplish black, marbled with whitish veins. Real truffles would never have such a thick skin!</p>
		      <p>All Scleroderma are considered toxic, producing gastrointestinal disorders. In Spain are included in Annex D (species that can not be traded commercially) of <a href="setas decreto comercializacion English.htm#pd">Spanish Royal Decree 30/2009 of 16 January 2009, laying down the health conditions for mushrooms trade for food</a>. (Spanish)</p>
		      <p><em>Scleroderma polyrhizum</em> is the species most often confused with true truffles.</p>
		      <h1><a name="pisolithus"></a>PISOLITHUS ARHIZUS</h1>
              <p>Synonym <em>Pisolithus tinctorius</em>.  This fungus is known in Australia as &quot;the horse dung fungus&quot; and in Europe as &quot;the Bohemian truffle&quot; (B&ouml;hmische tr&uuml;ffel). It is a fungus confused with true truffles because their initial underground growth. It is very easy to identify at this stage of its development if you cut the Pisolithus in half to see the inside (gleba). <A HREF="trufas/Pisolithus arhizus peridiolos.jpg" rel="shadowbox" title="Pisolithus arhizus peridiolos"><img title="Pisolithus arhizus peridiolos" alt="Pisolithus arhizus peridiolos" src="trufas/Pisolithus arhizus peridiolos.jpg" height="240" align="left" style="margin: 3px 10px" hspace="3"></A>Then you can see  as the glebe is composed of numerous small chambers with pea-sized spore packages (pseudoperidioles), changing in appearance and color as they ripen: yellow at bottom,  blackish brown and juicy in the middle part, brown and powdery on top</p>
              <p><em>Pisolithus arhizus</em> are very variable in external appearance as they ripen. In most cases people only see the <em>Pisolithus</em> fruiting bodies in the advanced <a href="trufas/Pisolithus arhizus03.jpg" rel="shadowbox" title="Pisolithus: powdery stage">powdery stage</a>. It can reach 30 cm in height because of a pseudostipe.</p>
              <p>Pisolithus can grow in very arid places. You often find them along the edges of roads and highways where they can even push up the pavement. It is a widespread species.</p>
              <p>Pisolithus arhizus has been used as natural dye and it is considered edible when young. We have not ever tasted a Pisolithus. You have to admit that it does not look very appetizing...</p>
              <h1><a name="meandriformis"></a>CHOIROMYCES MEANDRIFORMIS</h1>
              <p><a href="Choiromyces venosus English.htm">FULL DESCRIPTION</a>. In Northern Europe it is known as <em>Choiromyces venosus</em> and eaten as a delicacy. However, it is considered toxic (gastrointestinal irritant) in Southern Europe. In Spain are included in Annex D (species that can not be traded commercially) of <a href="setas decreto comercializacion.htm#pd">Spanish Royal Decree 30/2009 of 16 January 2009, laying down the health conditions for mushrooms trade for food</a>.</p>
              <p>They often protrude through the soil surface, in summer and autumn,  and reach large sizes. These <em>Choiromyces</em> grow in acid soils with high rainfall and prefer clayey soils. <a href="hipogeos/Choiromyces venosus02.jpg" rel="shadowbox" title="False truffles: Choiromyces venosus"><img title="Choiromyces venosus" alt="Choiromyces venosus" src="hipogeos/Choiromyces venosus02.jpg" height="240" align="left" style="margin: 3px 10px" hspace="3"></a>We have found them in Navarra associated with <em>Quercus robur</em> and in Hungarian under <em>Picea abies</em>.</p>
              <p>They are whitish to yellowish brown, with reddish  spots at maturity, often irregular in form. The inside is white to cream or yellowish-brown, marbled with sterile, white, <a href="hipogeos/Choiromyces meandriformis gleba.jpg" rel="shadowbox" title="Choiromyces meandriformis gleba: meander-like veins">meander-like veins</a> (which is the origin of the name meandriformis) surrounding the fertile areas.</p>
              <p>Strong odor, distinctive, becoming unpleasant at maturity.</p>
              <p>Because of its large size and whitish color, <em>Choiromyces meandriformis</em> is sold fraudulently as &#8220;white truffle&#8221; for its resemblance to <em>Tuber magnatum</em>, although their texture, aroma and flavor are completely different.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <h1><a name="magnusii"></a>CHOIROMYCES MAGNUSII</h1>
              <p><a href="Choiromyces magnusii English.htm">FULL DESCRIPTION</a>. They are highly prized in parts of Extremadura (Spain) and Andalusia (Spain). There, <em>Choiromyces magnusii</em> is known as &quot;criadilla jarera&quot; and eaten as a delicacy. It is a spring species that grows in acid soil and always associated with <em>Cistus ladanifer</em>. Although its development is hypogeous, <a href="hipogeos/Choiromyces magnusii02.jpg" rel="shadowbox" title="Choiromyces magnusii"><img title="Choiromyces magnusii" alt="Choiromyces magnusii" src="hipogeos/Choiromyces magnusii02.jpg" height="240" align="left" style="margin: 3px 10px" hspace="3"></a>you can detect its presence through the cracks forming in the soil as they grow. They reach a large size, up to 10-12 cm, and are whitish to light brown, irregular in form, gibbous, lobed, with deep grooves that make them very difficult to clean when cooking. The inside is white to brown, depending on their maturity, marbled with sterile, white, sinuous veins, no completely surrounding the fertile areas.</p>
              <p>Faint odor, distinctive.</p>
              <p>For several years, a gastronomic fair dedicated to this &#8220;truffle&#8221; is held in El Almendro (Huelva - Spain), in April. There, <em>Choiromyces magnusii</em> is known as &#8220;turma&#8221; and &#8220;white truffle of El And&eacute;valo&#8221;</p>
